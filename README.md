# SupplyTrace
SupplyChainTraceability.sol is a Solidity smart contract that enables transparent product verification for small producers.  It allows manufacturers to register product batches on-chain with key details like product ID, IPFS hash, and quality information — while consumers can verify authenticity by scanning a QR code or entering the batch ID.
